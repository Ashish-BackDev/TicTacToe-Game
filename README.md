#TicTacToe Game (C++)
Welcome to the TicTacToe game! This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic TicTacToe game written in C++. Players alternate between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) to place their marks on the board. The game will end when either a player wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw.

#Game Overview
: Players: Two players: Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
: Objective: The goal is to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
: Board: A 3x3 grid with positions numbered from 1 to 9. Players take turns choosing a number between 1 and 9 to place their mark.
: End Game: The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row or when there are no more empty spots left on the board, resulting in a draw.

#How to Play
1. Start the Game: Once the game starts, Player 1 (X) will be asked to enter a number between 1 and 9 to place their mark on the board.
2. Player Turns: Players alternate turns. After each move, the board is updated, and the program checks if there is a winner or a draw.
3. Invalid Moves: If a player tries to make a move on an occupied spot, they are prompted to try again.
4. Game Outcome: The program will check if there is a winner or if the game has ended in a draw, and will display the result.
5. Replay Option: After each game, players are given the option to play again.

#Features
: Game Loop: Players take turns entering a number between 1 and 9. The program updates the board after each move and checks for a win or draw.
: Board Display: The current state of the board is displayed after every move.
: Input Validation: Ensures players enter valid numbers between 1 and 9. Invalid input is rejected.
: Game Outcome: The program checks for a winner or a draw and displays the result.
: Replay Option: After the game ends, players are prompted to decide if they want to play again.
